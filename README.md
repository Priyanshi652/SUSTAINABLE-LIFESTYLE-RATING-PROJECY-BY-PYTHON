With this project, we'll be working with a dataset containing information about various sustainable lifestyle habits, such as energy consumption, water usage, waste management, transportation, and diet. We'll use Python's powerful libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib, to analyze and visualize the data, uncovering trends, patterns, and correlations.
